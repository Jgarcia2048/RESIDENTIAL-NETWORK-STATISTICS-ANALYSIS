In this project I was concerned about network speed availability in communities with lower incomes. I extracted census data that separated counties into varying levels of income-per-capita, with this information I proceeded to deploy a Raspberry Pi 4 device with packet sniffer and a high gain transceiver to intercept packets in these different counties. My results showed that higher income counties typically had higher speed internet connection as well as high speed (5GHz) internet connected devices such as smartphones, this was concerning at the time where COVID hit the hardest and required everyone to go remote.
